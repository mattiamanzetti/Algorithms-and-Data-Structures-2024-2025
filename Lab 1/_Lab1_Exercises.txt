First exercise: Check even/odd

Create a program with the following functions:
    - "createRandomList", that receives in input two numbers (N, R) and returns a list of N integer numbers with random values from 0 to R
    - "countEvenOdd", that given a list of numbers returns how many even and odd numbers contains
    - "splitEvenOdd", that given a list of numbers returns two lists, one containing the even numbers and the other the odd numbers
Test the program with N = 100 and R = 100

NOTE: use import random and the function random.randint()




Second exercise: Capitalize the first letter of all the words in a text

Create a program with the following functions:
    - "readTxtFile", that reads a text file and memorize all the lines in a list
    - "capitalizeWords", that capitalizes the first letter of each word in each line and save the result in a new list
    - "writeTxtFile", that write the capitalized text in a new text file
Test the program using the file "loremipsum.txt" and write the result is "loremipsum_cap.txt"

NOTE: Try to avoid capitalize(), other useful methods to modify strings are split(), upper(), join()
