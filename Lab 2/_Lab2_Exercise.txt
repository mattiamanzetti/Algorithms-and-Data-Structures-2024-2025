
Exercise: Simulate a Supermarket

A Supermarket has a variable number of check desks specified at the beginning
Each check desk has an ID, a queue of waiting customers, and a current customer (initialized to None)
Each Customer has an ID and a random number of items (from 1 to max_number) to check out

The check out of a Check desk works as follows:
    IF there is a current Customer and its number of items is zero:
        print a message with Check desk and Customer IDs (e.g., "Check desk 1 served Customer number 2")
        if the queue is not empty dequeue the next Customer that becomes the new current Customer
    ELSE:
        decrease the number of items of the current Customer by 1

NOTE: a check desk can have an empty queue

Given a list of N Customers run the Supermarket simulation until all of them are served
During the simulation:
- a new customer enters in the Supermarket (i.e. is removed from the list) with probability 30% and always goes to the emptiest cash desk
- all the check desks are continuously checked out
HINT: create a while loop that iterates until both the list of customers and all the queues are empty,
      at each iteration a new customer can enter, and all the check decks run their check out

At the end of the simulation print the total number of customers served by each cash desk

You can use as reference the example "PrintSimulation.py" seen during the Theoretical Lecture
