FIRST EXERCISE: LEVEL SUM

Given a Binary Tree, compute the sum of all the nodes present in a level for each level of the tree

NOTE: you can use a Stack or a Queue, but can be solved even without

E.g.

          20             Sum of level 0 = 20
        /    \
      15      40         Sum of level 1 = 55
    /    \      \
  10      30     50      Sum of level 2 = 90
    \           /
     22        3         Sum of level 3 = 25







SECOND EXERCISE: VERIFY COMPLETE

Verify if a binary tree is complete or not

NOTE: you can use a Stack or a Queue, but can be solved even without

E.g.:

               A              TRUE
            /     \
          B        C
        /   \     /  \
       D    E    F    G
     /  \
    H    I

               A              FALSE
            /     \
          B        C
        /   \       \
       D     E       G


               A              FALSE
            /     \
          B        C
        /   \
       D    E
     /  \
    H    I
