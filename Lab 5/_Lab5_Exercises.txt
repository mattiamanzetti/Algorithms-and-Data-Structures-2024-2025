FIRST EXERCISE: SUM OF CHILDREN NODES

Given a Binary Tree, verify if for every node, the key value of the node is equal to the sum of the key values of its left and right children
Leaf nodes always satisfy this property

HINTS: you need to recursively check each node

This tree satisfy the property

	   10
	  /  \
	 8    2
	/ \    \
   3   5    2


This tree does not satisfy the property

	   10
	  /  \
	 8    2
	/ \    \
   3   3    2


NOTE: you can use a Stack or a Queue




SECOND EXERCISE: VERIFY SIBLINGS

Given a Binary Tree and the two nodes A and B determine whether A and B are siblings or not

E.g.
              35                     A=2 and B=12 are siblings
           /      \                  A=40 and B=7 are siblings
         18 	   10                A=7 and B=21 are NOT siblings
        /   \     /   \               A=18 and B=1 are NOT siblings
       3     5   7    40
     /  \            /   \
    2   12         21     1
