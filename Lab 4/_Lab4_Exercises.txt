First Exercise: Reverse a Queue

Reverse the content of a Queue using Recursion
You can use only one Queue, no other data structures are needed
You cannot use any iterative loop



Second Exercise: Pascal's Triangle

Compute the Pascal's (or Tartaglia) Triangle using recursion
The rows of Pascal's triangle are conventionally enumerated starting with row n=0 at the top (the 0th row).
The triangle may be constructed in the following manner:
Each row begins and ends with a 1. In row 0 there is only a 1. 
Each entry of each subsequent row is computed adding together the 2 numbers directly above it

        1           n = 0
      1   1         n = 1
    1   2   1       n = 2
  1   3   3   1     n = 3
1   4   6   4   1   n = 4
...

To simplify You can print the triangle like this:
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 3, 3, 1]
[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
...

NOTE: You can use iterative loop(s) inside recursion




Third Exercise (DIFFICULT)

Reversing the content of Stack using recursion
You can use only one Stack, no other data structures are needed
You cannot use any iterative loop

HINT: you need 2 recursive functions one to empty the stack one to fill in
