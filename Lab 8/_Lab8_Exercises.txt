FIRST EXERCISE: FIND CLOSEST NODE

Given a BST and a number N, return the node key in the BST that is closest to N,
(i.e. the node key with the minimum absolute difference with N)

E.g.
Given the following BST and N=7 the closest node is 5, since |7-5| = 2 is the minimum difference

             15
         /       \
       10        20
      /  \     /   \
    5    12   19   25

NOTE: you can use a Stack or a Queue but it is not mandatory



SECOND EXERCISE: IS GRAPH A TREE

Verify if an undirected graph is a tree

An undirected graph is a tree if the following conditions are verified:
- There are no cycles
- The graph is connected

HINTS: We can use DFS to perform both the verifications!
