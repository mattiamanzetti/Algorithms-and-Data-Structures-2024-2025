First Exercise: Reverse Words

Write a program to reverse each word in a string using a Stack.
Words must stay in the same initial position
E.g., "Algorithm and Data Structures" will become "mhtiroglA dna ataD serutcurtS"



Second Exercise: Delete the middle element of Stack

Write a program that removes the middle element of a Stack
E.g.: input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      output [1, 2, 4, 5]

Try to solve it in two ways, using recursion and using iteration

NOTE: you can use an auxiliary stack



Third Exercise: Redundant parentheses (DIFFICULT)

Write a program that checks whether a valid expression has redundant parentheses or not
E.g.:    ( (a + b) )            # Redundant
         ( a + (b) / c )        # Redundant
         ( a + ( (b + c) ) )    # Redundant
         (a + b * (c - d) )     # Not redundant
